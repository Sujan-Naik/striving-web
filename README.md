# Striving

A platform that helps turn raw ideas into fully structured software projects.

It provides a guided workflow that moves from Idea → Project → Features → Documentation/Manuals → Publish, ensuring that
every step of the development cycle is captured and organized.

Key features include:

- AI powered GitHub Repository Generator – instantly create or edit GitHub repositories with AI assistance.

- Feature Architecture Visualization – map and organize features into a tree-like structure that stays in sync with
  documentation and manuals

- Documentation & Manuals System – generate and manage documentation for Collaborators and Manuals for end users.

- View and Manage Product Collaborators.

Publish your manuals and documentation to collaborators or end-users with a shareable link.

The goal of Striving is to make open source software development transparent, structured, and easy to publish, so ideas
don’t just stay concepts—they evolve into complete, documented, and shareable projects.

We also provide an intuitive AI Chatbot, allowing you to select a model from OpenAI.
